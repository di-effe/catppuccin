# Configuration 

## Colors
In a theme like this colors are spread all over the place and it's not fun keep track of everything, every time you want to change something. That's why I am using a custom color script to do the dirty job for me.

Colors are set each time the *UP* script run

```
source $SCRIPTPATH/scripts/colors.sh catppuccin
```

Two color themes are already available to choose from:
- catppuccin
- catppuccin2

Long story short `colors.sh` performs different tasks, mostly `sed`, in all files where colors are set.
The parameter after the script is communicating `colors.sh` to read from the colors variables from `scripts/colors_<THEME_NAME>.sh`, and by default that would be `scripts/colors_catppuccin.sh`

```
## Catppuccin theme
COLOR_BAR_BACKGROUND="#332E41"
COLOR_BAR_FOREGROUND="#B7E5E6"
COLOR_BACKGROUND="#332E41"
COLOR_FOREGROUND="#DFDEF1"
COLOR_FOREGROUND_DARK="#988BA2"
COLOR_PRIMARY="#C6AAE8"
COLOR_SECONDARY="#DFDEF1"
COLOR_ALTERNATE="#C6AAE8"
COLOR_INACTIVE="#6E6C7E"
COLOR_BORDER_ACTIVE="#C6AAE8"
COLOR_BORDER_INACTIVE="#1E1E28"
COLOR_BORDER_FLOATING="#F2CDCD"
COLOR_APPLET_BACKGROUND="#332E41"
COLOR_APPLET_BACKGROUND_LIGHT="#575268"

```

So, if you want to change colors manually comment the source `$SCRIPTPATH/scripts/colors.sh catppuccin` or your changes will be overwritten.

My suggestion, to avoid going crazy, would be to use the same method and 
- create a custom color theme
- add your theme to the `themes=(catppuccin catppuccin2);` array in `colors.sh`
- optionally adapt `colors.sh` to your needs


## Applets

This theme doesn´t have a launcher and powermenu modules configured in Polybar, but you can configured a few keybindings to launch some Rofi applets.

For example you could add these to your `config.toml`

```
# Theme applets

# Launcher
[[keybind]]
command = "Execute"
value = "$HOME/.config/leftwm/themes/current/scripts/launcher.sh"
modifier = ["modkey"]
key = "space"

# Powermenu
[[keybind]]
command = "Execute"
value = "$HOME/.config/leftwm/themes/current/scripts/powermenu.sh"
modifier = ["modkey", "Shift"]
key = "p"

# Layout switcher
[[keybind]]
command = "Execute"
value = "$HOME/.config/leftwm/themes/current/scripts/layout.sh"
modifier = ["modkey", "Shift"]
key = "l"
```

Run a `leftwm-check` to ensure you don´t have multiple bindings on the same keys.



## Wallpapers

*up* is configured with the options to
- set random wallpapers from the /wallpapers folder
- set ONE wallpaper for all displays
- set MULTIPLE wallpapers for all displays (default)

Uncomment what you prefer and comment the rest. It should be clear enough reading the file.


## Polybar

### Pulseaudio Control
This is an interesting module you might want to use, just keep in mind it will grab your device description from

```
pactl list sinks | grep device.description
```

and that is usually a very long string.
The pulseaudio-control module in *polybar.modules* has been configured to use fancier nicknames for speakers and headphone, but you have to replace my values with yours.

For speakers (without any wired or bluetooth headphone connected) check
```
pactl list sinks short | cut -f2
```

and use the output here
```
--sink-nickname "VALUE_DETECTED_HERE:蓼 Speakers" 
```

For wired headphones, plug them, check again
```
pactl list sinks short | cut -f2
```

and use the output here
```
--sink-nickname "VALUE_DETECTED_HER: Headphones"
```


### Systray
Systray has beed disabled by default in *polybar.config*
```
tray-position = none
```
If you want to use it change position and adjust the **tray-offset-x** value.
